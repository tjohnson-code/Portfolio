        A Frontend Web Developer with a strong foundation in project management.
        Over the past six years, I've worked as an Assistant Production Manager
        at a non-profit organization, while also feeding my interest in web
        development through college courses and online materials - learning
        whatever I could in my spare time. Over the years my passion grew, which
        led me to focus full-time on pursuing a front-end career. My skill set
        includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS, and Next.js.
      </p>

      <p className="pb-3">
        As a 36-year-old professional, I bring a unique blend of experience and
        expertise to the table. My background in project management helped shape
        my ability to effectively coordinate resources, meet deadlines, and
        communicate with diverse teams, making me an ideal candidate for
        projects that require a strong sense of organization and attention to
        detail.
      </p>

      <p className="pb-3">
        I pride myself on creating clean, accessible, and user-friendly websites
        that offer seamless user experiences. By combining my technical skills
        with strong time management, I deliver web solutions that not only meet
        clients' needs but also exceed their expectations.

        When I'm not coding or managing projects, you can find me: exploring the
        outdoors with my fiance and our 5 year old Siberian Husky (who likes to
        lead us into the unknown).
