The snow came down at a rate of 2" per hour. The wind whipped, swirled, and flowed around as my form came to be. I am **The Abominable Snow Troll**
I chose to post on a grill to menacingly remind anyone that I owned the night. Just try to turn up the heat and I'll double the **biggest snow** storm ever recorded!
