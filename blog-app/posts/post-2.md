No one came to save me. I was too menacing. I lost touch with reality and forgot spring was right around the corner. I'm melting into a puddle that will eventually evaporate.

_I will be back!_

- Keep your eyes peeled
- For the first snow will bring **doom**
- I will come back to cover the world in piercing flakes of ice

**The Abominable Snow Troll**
