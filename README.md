## Welcome to my Portfolio!

This repository is meant to demonstrate my abilities and continued growth as a developer.
I am currently hosting the below projects @ [webdevtj.com](https://webdevtj.com).

### Projects:

#### Blog App

_I built this blog to help me learn Typescript. I also used React, Tailwind CSS, Next.js, and Sanity.io was used for a headless Content Management System._
